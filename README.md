# Text_Analysis_Final_Project

This project analyzes how the public discusses ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) investing on YouTube. I collected comments from a set of ESG-related videos (with more than 50 comments) and applied text cleaning, VADER sentiment scoring, and TF-IDF keyword extraction to examine the sentiments and themes of these conversations.

I first analyzed sentiment overall (positive, neutral, or negative). As that seems to reveal a relatively normal distribution, I then analyzed sentiment at the video level to see how individual videos get different types of responses. After that, I decided to analyze comments' sentiment at the channel level (pro-ESG, neutral, anti-ESG, and unknown), identifying broader patterns linked to creator's ESG stance, audience composition, and ideological leanings. Finally, I looked at the sentiment over time to see how overall sentiment changes over time.

By visualizing sentiment trends across videos and channels, this project demonstrates how social media data can reveal nuanced public perceptions of ESG and the underlying tensions shaping sustainable finance discourse online. I hope this project highlights the importance for regulators and policymakers to consider the media ecosystems in which ESG messaging circulates.
